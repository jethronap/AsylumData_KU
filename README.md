# Trying to understand Asylum Practices in Denmark.

This repository contains the source code for the analysis of data from the Danish Refugee Appeals Board (FlygtningenÃ¦vnet). The data are case summaries in textual format and are publicly available from https://fln.dk/praksis.

The source code for the steps of the analysis is included in each jupyter notebook. Notebooks starting with `UH` refer to cases denoted as Unkown Homeland. `ALL` is used for all other cases.

## Running the notebooks:

Before running the notebooks please `cd` into the `requirements` then

> `pip install - r requirements_(respective name).txt`

This will install the appropriate dependencies for each notebook. 

Please run first:

> `pip install - r requirements_utilities.txt`

This will install all dependencies used in the helpers functions found [in this subdirectory](https://github.com/jethronap/AsylumData_KU/tree/main/utilities).
